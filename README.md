# Debouncing


Debouncing is a technique in programming that helps prevent time-consuming tasks from being triggered so frequently that they slow down the performance of a web page. In simpler terms, it controls how often a function is called.

In JavaScript, debouncing is commonly used to enhance browser performance. Sometimes, certain actions on a web page involve complex computations that take up time. If these actions are triggered too frequently, it can significantly impact the browserâ€™s performance, especially since JavaScript operates on a single thread.
